12:10 - Aras' and Andrej's discussion about what database to use (PostgreSQL vs. MySQL)
		NOTE: Django web framework IS NOT covered in Python course, Flask will be.
		
* Vidmantas joins *

18:20 - Review of general progress
		NOTE: 	Add folders to Git Repo	-	Andrej
				Jira 	-	Aras
				
18:23 - Discuss technologies and frameworks that we might want to use
		NOTE:	MySQL the most probably will used
				We will try to use Python for our backend
				Micro framework vs. full-stack framework
					Micro framework advantages:
						1. Can be undestanded faster
						2. Can start being used in our project more faster
						
					Full-stack framework (most likely Django):
						1. More features
						2. No risk that there will be need to rewrite whole application due to missing feature in a micro framework
				
18:40 -	Consider what steps to take next in the design process
		1. Start thinking off milestone idea
		2. Start with requirements specification
			a) Purpose of the system
			b) A high-level overview of the system
			c) Functional and non-functional requirements
			
18:51 - Reviewing ideas
	
Decided:
		Use Python with full-stack framework
	
Tasks:
	- Vidmantas (and optionally Andrej) - search for web page templates (bootstrap)
	- Aras 		- Add folders to Git Repo
	- Andrej 	- Add folders to Git Repository

19:00 - Meeting start, arguing about multilangual support
	Decided: Postpone translating pages and make it the lowest priority. If we will have tie to implement this - we will do this.

19:10 - Reconsidering project scope

Noticed:
	Missing constraint between a publication and methodic group.


Agreed:
	Create test cases which will be performed manually.
	Use 'is_public' attribute of publication entity to show/hide author of publication.
	Android has higher priority than Methodic Groups.
	
Decided:
	This week we are going to focus on Android application and material filters.
